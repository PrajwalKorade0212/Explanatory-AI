# Explanatory-AI

## Overview

Explanatory-AI is a project focused on providing interpretability to machine learning models. It leverages several popular techniques such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to offer insights into model predictions.

## Features

- **SHAP Implementation**: Provides SHAP values to explain the output of machine learning models.
- **LIME Implementation**: Uses LIME for local interpretability of models.
- **Support for Multiple Models**: Includes implementations for Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and Convolutional Neural Networks.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (specified in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/PrajwalKorade0212/Explanatory-AI.git
    cd Explanatory-AI
    ```

2. Install the necessary packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Dataset**: Place your dataset in the `dataset` folder.
2. **Running Models**: Execute the corresponding Python script for the model you want to interpret:
    - For Decision Tree:
        ```sh
        python decision_tree.py
        ```
    - For Random Forest:
        ```sh
        python random_forest.py
        ```
    - For Support Vector Machine:
        ```sh
        python support_vector_machine.py
        ```
    - For Convolutional Neural Network:
        ```sh
        python convolutional_neural_network_model.py
        ```

3. **Interpreting Results**: Use the SHAP or LIME scripts to interpret model outputs:
    - For SHAP:
        ```sh
        python shap_implementation.py
        ```
    - For LIME:
        ```sh
        python lime_implementation.py
        ```
